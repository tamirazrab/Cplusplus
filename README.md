Casino-project-september
Touching this old 2 year old project, time when I didn't had much knowledge about programming in general. Seen too many mistakes, too many blunters, too many WET's ( Writing everything twice) and also DRY ( Repeating myself ) again and again. It's a spaghetti code, which needs to be converted in a proper and functional clean code.
- There's no place in here for new features. Requirements are fixed and simple.
- Lot's of room for enhancements and improvements.
